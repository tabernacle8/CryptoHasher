# CryptoHasher

This is a simple Java program I wrote in 2022 to sign and validate messages using the bare minimum in doing so

This project allowed us to sign code from USB drives on school computers, without installing any software or violating the school policy
Back then, we thought it was really cool, so its available here for anyone to use
